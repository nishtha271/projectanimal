                    <h2 class="title"><a href="#">Our Vision</a></h2>
                    <p>
                            In a world in turmoil caused by war, economic pressures and environmental problems, it is easy to forget that we are not the only species living and surviving on this planet.

                            Large scale interference by humans in the animal world and nature is causing immense suffering for animals and nature alike.
                            
                            Compassion for all living beings is the driving force to rescue and rehabilitate animals in distress.
                            
                            We hope that compassion expressed in action will create a new balance in the human-animal-nature relationship. This is in the interest of all living beings.                    </p>
